Promises Working Group Repository


This repo serves as a central place for Node.js Promises work coordination.

The Promises  WG is dedicated to the support and improvement of promises in Node and the npm ecosystem. We address and discuss promise related issues with NodeJS. 


Topics we'd like to cover:

 - How can debugging be made easier in Node for promise users.
 - Post mortem debugging with promises.
 - Promise cancellation and how APIs would interact with it when it lands.
 - How async/await support would look like.
 - How promise APIs would look like in core.
 - Documentation of V8's implementation, what hooks it provides and how to work with it.
 - How to make sure promises don't get in the way of callback users with core support.
 - How/if to get AsyncWrap to work with promises.
